# Flask RESTful API

Here in this repository, you will find a flask RESTful API implementation from scratch.

There are several sections which I followed from the course [REST APIs with Flask and Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-api-flask-and-python/). Each section's assignments is in its particular directory.

Before getting started, you need to setup a virtual environment and install all the dependencies. For installing the dependencies follow the instruction as mentioned below:
Note:  All the requirements for this entire project is listed in `requirements.txt`. Alternatively, you can use other python environment. Here I've used `virtualenv`.

To install `virtualenv` in Linux: `sudo apt install virtualenv`

1. First, install python virtual environment: `virtualenv -p python3 <environment-name>`
2. Activate the virtual environment as: `soucrce path-to-environment/bin/activate`
3. Install all the dependencies as: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Now, to run the app, simply enter the command: `python3 <app-name>.py`
